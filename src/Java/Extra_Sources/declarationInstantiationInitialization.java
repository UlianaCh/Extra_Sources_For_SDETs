        /*In Java, declaration, instantiation, and initialization are three key
        concepts related to working with variables.
        1.Declaration:

        This is when you tell the compiler about a variable's name and type
         but don't allocate any memory for it. Essentially, you're saying,
         "Hey, I'm going to use this variable, and it's going to be of this type,
         but it does not allocate memory or assign a value to the variable.*/

        int myNumber;

        /*
        2.Instantiation:
        This term is often used in the context of object-oriented programming.
        Instantiation is the creation of an object or an instance of a class.
        It involves using the new keyword followed by a constructor to create
        an object in memory.*/



        /*
        3.Initialization:
        Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable.
        It can occur at the time of declaration or later in the code.*/

        int myNumber2 = 42; // Initialization at the time of declaration
        int anotherNumber; // Declaration
        anotherNumber = 55; // Initialization later in the code

        /*In summary:
        Declaration is like telling the program, "I'm going to use this variable."
        Instantiation is creating an instance of a class or an object.
        Initialization is giving a variable its initial value.*/
